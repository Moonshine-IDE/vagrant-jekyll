# jekyll-vagrant
This VM provides a fresh Jekyll instalation.

We use a standard Ubuntu/Bionic as the base image, and install Ruby + Jekyll.
The website source code is copied from the host machine to the VM where Jekyll can be executed transforming the templates, text files and assets into a static website.

The generated website will be localted within the standard `_site` folder of the Jekyll project sources.

We provide this Ruby+Jekyll VM as an alternative for developers to be able to work without the need of having Ruby or Jekyll installed into their main development environments.
